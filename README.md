# farming-simulator-mod-loader
A simple mod list downloader for farming simulator.

## Preparation
The script only supports mod pages from *www.farming-simulator.com*.
This file must be in the same directory as the script. There is an example mods file in the repository.
Create a file named **fsmods.txt** with one link in each line.

## Running
The script looks for the **fsmods.txt** file and parses it as links, it retrieves the download link and downloads the *.zip* file.
After editing the script, double-click the *.exe* file and you're good to go.

##TLDR
Just clone or download the zip, edit the *.txt* file with your favorite mods and run the script, *.exe* or *.py*.
